                    <p class="heading">Python</p>
                    <p class="cont">Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
                        Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
                        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
                        Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                    <p class="heading">C</p>
                    <p class="cont">C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.
                         By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.
                          Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems. C is an imperative procedural language.
                           It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities,
                            the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.</p>

                    <p class="heading">Java</p>
                    <p class="cont">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once,
                         run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities 
                          that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, 
                         particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>
